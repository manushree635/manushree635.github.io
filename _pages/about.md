I'm an MS CS student at Georgia Tech advised by [Prof. Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/), working on computer vision and mulitmodal AI. I was an ML Research intern with Adobe during summer of 2024, where I worked at the intersection of HCI and NLP.

I previously interned at the Aritifical Intelligence and Robotics Lab at IISc Bangalore, advised by [Prof. Suresh Sundaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5iAMbhMAAAAJ) and [Dr. Chandan Gautam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=G-e_OoIAAAAJ) on zero-shot learning and domain generalization. I also interned at IBM Research under [Dr. Diptikalyan Saha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=epwtlHgAAAAJ) on explainable AI. I also had the privilege of working with [Prof. Harish Kumar JR](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6tpDcKIAAAAJ).
<!-- In 2019, I was a Google Summer of Code ([GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6054863815835648/)) student for Open Robotics, where I worked on creating a documentation index for Gazebo. During my undergrad, I was also a part of my college's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ([SRM-AUV](https://srmauvsoftware.github.io/)) team. -->

On the side, I also mentor undergraduate students, getting started with research at Research Society Manipal.
<!-- On the side, I have been a [technical writer and editor](https://www.scoutapm.com/blog/author/mukul-khanna) for the [ScoutAPM](https://www.scoutapm.com) software development [blog](https://www.scoutapm.com/blog). Alongside, I've also dabbled with hosting a data science podcast ([Deep Neural Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKsk3K4Z-1AVwIzEi9pk-ayEh9uxdyweL)), where I interviewed academics and scientists about their research, insights and their journeys. I'm also interested in the ideas of [Zettelkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOY-drtTJX0) knowledge management and briefly took to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC66w1T4oMv66Jn1LR5CW2yg) to share my experiences (which happened to garner 80k views!). -->
