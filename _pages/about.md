I'm a research intern with the CVMLP lab led by [Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/) and [Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/). My research interests lie on the intersection of embodied AI and computer vision. Previously, I was a research fellow at the Robotics Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad, advised by [Prof. K. Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/). Earlier yet, I was a research intern at IIT Gandhinagar, advised by [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/).

In 2019, I was a Google Summer of Code ([GSOC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6054863815835648/)) student for Open Robotics, where I worked on creating a documentation index for Gazebo. During my undergrad, I was also a part of my college's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ([SRM-AUV](https://srmauvsoftware.github.io/)) team.

On the side, I'm a [technical writer and editor](https://www.scoutapm.com/blog/author/mukul-khanna) for the [ScoutAPM](https://www.scoutapm.com) software development [blog](https://www.scoutapm.com/blog). Along this string of co-curricular endeavours, I've also dabbled with hosting a data science podcast - [Deep Neural Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKsk3K4Z-1AVwIzEi9pk-ayEh9uxdyweL), where I interviewed academics and scientists about their research, insights and their journeys. I'm also interested in the ideas of [Zettelkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOY-drtTJX0) knowledge management and briefly took to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC66w1T4oMv66Jn1LR5CW2yg) to share my experiences (which happened to garner 1.25k subscribers + ~70k views).
